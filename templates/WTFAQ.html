<p><b>Who can see this page?</b></p>
<p>In order to see this page you need to be either the Khaleesi herself or one of her trusted <a href="http://m.westeros.org/index.php/Bloodrider">Bloodriders</a>. <small style="font-size: 11px;">Yes I know Missendei is not a bloodrider, but doesn't Bacon look lovely in her dress?</small>

<span class="anchor" id="whatedit"></span>
<p><b>What can I edit and what should I never touch?</b></p>
<p>In the <a href="{%url 'admin:index' %}">Admin</a> section you'll see a lot of objects, like:
  <ul><li>Groups</li><li>Users</li><li>Registrants</li><li>Etc...</li></ul>
Please never touch <b>Groups</b> or <b>Site</b>.<br>
You can edit <b>Users</b> but don't create any Users, they are automatically created when a new <b>Registrant</b> gets made.
Basically every real human being gets a User, which can hold several Registrants. For example, if Michela Dai Zovi aka Dahmernatrix goes to RollerCon every year,
every time you add a new Registrant (ie MVP 2015, Skater 2016, etc) with the same email address as one before (mdaizovi@gmail.com), it gets added to the User assosciated with that email address.
It would be possible to manually connect registrants with different email addresses, like if someone changes their email address, but lets pretend it's impossible because it's messy.

<span class="anchor" id="hownewattendee"></span>
<p><b>How do I input new Registrants (Attendees)?</b></p>
<p>You can input new attendees thorugh the Admin. On the top right of the screen, under the blue bar you should see two little grey buttons: <b>Import</b>, and <b>Add registrant</b>.<br>
  Use <b>Add registrant</b> if you just want to manually add a person or two. Please note that You have to input email, first_name, and last_name. Sk8name and Sk8number are optional,
  but if they do have a sk8number please enter it because that becomes their User display name forever. If they don't have one, like if they are a vendor, their first name will be the display name.<br>
  If you need to add a lot of people, use <b>Import</b>. You don't need to massage the data-- as long as it always looks like it did in 2016 it will translate how BPT says it how I want it-- but you need to make
  the excel sheet present the date <i>in the order</i> the computer expects it to be in.<br>
  To get an example of what it wants, export some existing registrants, because the order/format is the same for import and export.<br>
  Depending on what we decide re: ease of accidentally deleting everyone :-) the import button will either be by the import/add registrant buttons, or on the left from an Action dropdown, in the same place you can delete registrants.<br>
  Either way, export the registrant and it'll show you the order it wants. I tried to make it mirror the BPT reports as closely as possible.<br>
  <b>To format the BPT Excel sheet:</b><br>
  <ol><li>Take your BPT report, delete the first few rows down to and including "Will Call Tickets" so row 1 is the columns names, row 2 starts the data.</li>
    <li>Insert a column so that Column A is blank and Column B is the BPT Ticket ID.</li>
    <li>Delete Columns C-M (order date/event start date/event end date/attendee l name/attendee f name/etc) but keep Shipping State.</li>
      <li>Keep Shipping State and Shipping County, I use those for INTL. Delete Shipping Zip, Phone, Email, Card Number, Barcode, Box Office User, Order Notes.</li>
      <li>Keep Admission Level. Delete Price, Admitted, Question 1, Question 6, Question 16.</li>
      <li>So now your order should be:blank column, BPT Ticket ID, State, Country, Admission Level, Last Name, First Name, email, skate name, skate number,
        skill, gender, league affiliation, insurance carrier, insurance number, age group, willing to volunteer, favorite part.</li>
        <li>Last step: columns S,T,U, and V. Leave S blank, but then for T,U, and V use the example of the exported Registrants.
          T is the primary key of the Con this person is registering for, probably 2 for 2016 or 3 for 2017. Just copy and paste the values for con, con__city and con__year (example, "Las Vegas", "2016").</li>
          <li>Copy and paste the header (row 1) from the exported Registrant file, so that it's my header and not the BPT header on the excel sheet.</li>
          <li>Save file as an XLS somewhere. (XLSX doesn't work right, I don't know why it's an option)</li>
          <li>Go back to Admin on site, click <b>Import</b>, choose XLS (XLSX doesn't work right), and import. It'll show you what it's about to import before importing.</li>
          <li>Either be stoked you just imported 1,000 records in a few minutes, or, if there's a problem, take a screenshot and call me.</li></ol>
