<p><b>Who can see this page?</b></p>
<p>In order to see this page you need to be either the Khaleesi herself or one of her trusted <a href="http://m.westeros.org/index.php/Bloodrider">Bloodriders</a>.
  <small style="font-size: 11px;">Yes I know Missandei is not a bloodrider, but doesn't Bacon look lovely in her dress?</small>

<span class="anchor" id="whatedit"></span>
<p><b>What can I edit and what should I never touch?</b></p>
<p>In the <a href="{%url 'admin:index' %}">Admin</a> section you'll see a lot of objects, like:
  <ul><li>Groups</li><li>Users</li><li>Registrants</li><li>Etc...</li></ul>
Please never touch <b>Groups</b> or <b>Site</b>.<br>
You can edit <b>Users</b> but don't create any Users, they are automatically created when a new <b>Registrant</b> gets made.
Basically every real human being gets one User, which can hold several Registrants. For example, if Michela Dai Zovi aka Dahmernatrix goes to RollerCon every year,
every time you add a new Registrant (ie Dahmer's MVP pass in 2015, Dahmer's Skater pass in 2016, etc) with the same email address as one before (mdaizovi@gmail.com), it gets added to the User associated with that email address.<br>
Coaches are also connected to their Registrants through the User, which is how I had to do it do they wouldn't have to update their bio every year, and so their page would show all of their classes, not just one year's worth.<br>
It would be possible to manually connect registrants with different email addresses, like if someone changes their email address, but lets pretend it's impossible and encourage them to use the same email address always.

<p><b>Is there a way for me to enter Challenges or Rosters without the hassle of captains and accepting and stuff?</b>
<p>Yes.
  <ol><li>Assuming the target captains already exist as a Registrants, <a href="/admin/scheduler/roster/">make the Rosters in the Admin</a> (little grey "add roster +" oval in the right hand corner), and choose that Registrants as Captains.
    <br><b>IMPORTANT:</b> Make sure you are choosing the Registrant for the right year. As you know, many captains come every year and weird things could happen if Dahmer 2015 is captaining a 2016 team.</li>
    <li><a href="/admin/scheduler/challenge/">Make a Challenge in the Admin</a> (little grey "add challenge +" oval in the right hand corner),
      selecting the two teams you just made. Or one new team you just made and one existing team they made, whatever.</li>
    <li>Check both acceptance boxes (<b>Captain1accepted</b> and <b>Captain2accepted</b>)</li>
    <li>You don't need to touch <b>Created on</b>, that is automaticaly generated the first time it's saved,
      but you do need to give it a <b>Submitted on</b> time and date in order for it to count as submitted. Just click Now and Today, and then edit later if you want it to be set at a different time/date. That way you know the time/date will be in the right format.</li>
        <li>Save. The next time the users log in to RollerTron they'll see the same thing everyone else sees when they've completed the whole acceptance/submission process.</li></ol>

<span class="anchor" id="howchangeemail"></span>
<p><b>How do I change someone's email address?</b></p>
<ol><li><a href="/admin/auth/user/">Find the User in the Admin</a>, by <b>old</b> email address.</li>
  <li>Change the User email address <b>and</b> Username. It's best if we remain consistent and just keep them the same.</li>
  <li><a href="/admin/con_event/registrant/">Find the Registrant in the Admin</a>.</li>
    <li>You should see that the User field now displays the <b>new</b> email address. Change the Registrant email as well, for consistency.</li>
    <li>Save. Do it this way and they won't have to reset their password, just log in with the new email address as their username.</li></ol>
<p>The reason why I want you to do it this way is because if you only change the Registrant email address and remove the old User, a new User will be created,
  and it will be confusing for them when they forget they changed their email address and log in with their old one, and can't find any of their pass data.
  <br>The homeless User could also be confusing for an Admin someday.</p>

<span class="anchor" id="howINTL"></span>
<p><b>How do I make a Registrant INTL?</b></p>
<p>People become INTL in 1 of 3 ways.
<ol><li>If we know their country and if the Registrant's country is a country other than the Con they're registered for (probably always US, but I don't want to limit you!)</li>
  <li><b>or</b> if we know their state <b>and</b> that state is AK,HI or AP, then they are INTL automatically when they are saved.
    <br><i>Note: This will not work properly if you ever hold a RollerCon in Hawaii, Alaska, or on a military base.</i>
    <li><b>Or</b> an admin like you can make them INTL and it'll trust your judgement. In that case we don't need to know their county/state</li>
      <li>Save.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span class="anchor" id="hownewattendee"></span>
<p><b>How do I input new Registrants (Attendees)?</b></p>
<p>You can input new attendees through the Admin. On the top right of the screen, under the blue bar you should see two little grey buttons: <b>Import</b>, and <b>Add registrant</b>.<br>
  Use <b>Add registrant</b> if you just want to manually add a person or two. Please note that You have to input email, first_name, and last_name. Sk8name and Sk8number are optional,
  but if they do have a sk8number please enter it because that becomes their User display name forever. If they don't have one, like if they are a vendor, their first name will be the display name.<br>
  If you need to add a lot of people, use <b>Import</b>. You don't need to massage the data-- as long as it always looks like it did in 2016 it will translate how BPT says it how I want it-- but you need to make
  the excel sheet present the date <i>in the order</i> the computer expects it to be in.<br>
  To get an example of what it wants, export some existing registrants, because the order/format is the same for import and export.<br>
  Depending on what we decide re: ease of accidentally deleting everyone :-) the import button will either be by the import/add registrant buttons, or on the left from an Action dropdown, in the same place you can delete registrants.<br>
  Either way, export the registrant and it'll show you the order it wants. I tried to make it mirror the BPT reports as closely as possible.<br>
  <b>To format the BPT Excel sheet:</b><br>
  <ol><li>Take your BPT report, delete the first few rows down to and including "Will Call Tickets" so row 1 is the columns names, row 2 starts the data.</li>
    <li>Insert a column so that Column A is blank and Column B is the BPT Ticket ID.</li>
    <li>Delete Columns C-M (order date/event start date/event end date/attendee l name/attendee f name/etc) but keep Shipping State.</li>
      <li>Keep Shipping State and Shipping County, I use those for INTL. Delete Shipping Zip, Phone, Email, Card Number, Barcode, Box Office User, Order Notes.</li>
      <li>Keep Admission Level. Delete Price, Admitted, Question 1, Question 6, Question 16.</li>
      <li>So now your order should be:blank column, BPT Ticket ID, State, Country, Admission Level, Last Name, First Name, email, skate name, skate number,
        skill, gender, league affiliation, insurance carrier, insurance number, age group, willing to volunteer, favorite part.</li>
        <li>Last step: columns S,T,U, and V. Leave S blank, but then for T,U, and V use the example of the exported Registrants.
          T is the primary key of the Con this person is registering for, probably 2 for 2016 or 3 for 2017. Just copy and paste the values for con, con__city and con__year (example, "Las Vegas", "2016").</li>
          <li>Copy and paste the header (row 1) from the exported Registrant file, so that it's my header and not the BPT header on the excel sheet.</li>
          <li>Save file as an XLS somewhere. (XLSX doesn't work right, I don't know why it's an option)</li>
          <li>Go back to Admin on site, click <b>Import</b>, choose XLS (XLSX doesn't work right), and import. It'll show you what it's about to import before importing.</li>
          <li>Either be stoked you just imported 1,000 records in a few minutes, or, if there's a problem, take a screenshot and call me.</li></ol>
