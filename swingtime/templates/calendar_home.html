        <span class="anchor" id="whocansee"></span>
        <p><b>Who can see this page?</b></p>
        <p>Only the Khaleesi.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="anchor" id="selectact"></span>
        <p><b>How do I select activities to schedule?</b></p>
        <p>Use the <b>Challenges</b> and <b>Trainings</b> dropdowns on this page (middle top grey dropdowns) to decide which submitted activities you
        want to accept.
        <b>Submitted</b> will show you everything that has been submitted for the Con and has neither been accepted, nor rejected. If you reject an activity,
        it doesn't go away forever, but it will be put aside and only accessible from the <b>Rejected</b> page,
        so you don't need to see things you know you don't want every time you look at Submitted Challenges or Activities.<br>
        <b>Accepted</b> will only show you those you've accepted.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="anchor" id="howotto"></span>
        <p><b>How do I use the Auto Scheduler?</b></p>
        <p>First, you need to approve some Challenges or Trainings, because Otto only picks up on accepted activities.
        Next, you need to make some empty Occurrences to be filled; the <b>Upcoming Con</b> dropdown (left-most dropdown) will take you to the days.
        Then, <b><a href = "{% url 'act_unsched'%}">Un-Scheduled</a></b> (from the Schedule dropdown, right-hand side) will show you everything you've approved but haven't scheduled.
        From there it's pretty self-explanatory.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="anchor" id="howasst"></span>
        <p><b>How do I get scheduling assistance, if I don't want it to be auto-scheduled
          but still want to know about Blackouts and conflicts?</b></p>
        <p>Two ways:<br>
        1) If you make the occurrence with the calender, choose the challenge or training in the form and click "Check Schedule." That will look for any conflicts and let you know.<br>
        Or, if you go to <a href = "{% url 'act_unsched'%}">Un-Scheduled</a>, click on the number for blackouts for that activity, and that will take you to the
        Schedule Assistant page that lets you see possible matching empty Occurrences. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="anchor" id="howasstsave"></span>
        <p><b>How do I save a timeslot suggested by the Schedule Assistant?</b></p>
        <p>Click on the "Conflict Score" number in the table, and that will take you to the Occurrence form, with all of the data filled out.<br>
        Click "Check Schedule" to check for conflicts, or "Update" to save.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="anchor" id="howconfl"></span>
        <p><b>How do I check a coach's schedule for conflicts?</b></p>
        <p>You can check the entire schedule for any coach or captain conlficts by selecting "Check Conflicts" from the "Schedule" dropdown on the right.<br>
        You can also look at individual coach schedules by clicking on the calendar icon that you see on the training or coach page.
        <br>Only the Khaleesi can see this icon and follow this link. For everyone else, it just shows them their own schedule.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <span class="anchor" id="howvis"></span>
        <p><b>How do I make the schedule visible on the site?</b></p>
        <p>From the rightmost Schedule dropdown, go to "Status". There you can make the schedule "visible", so it will show up on the
          main Challenge and Training home pages. You can also make it "final", which will mean that only you can delete challenges or trainings that have been scheduled. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
