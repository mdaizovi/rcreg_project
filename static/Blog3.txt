<p><b>Long explanation for every page:</b><br>


<p><a href="/con/profile"><b>My Profile</b></a><br>
This shows you info for every RC you've bought a pass for. You can see your pass type and intl status, but you can't edit it. You can edit gender and skill, but if doing so will make you ineligible for something you've signed up for, it'll warn you before kicking you off the roster. You can only edit data for upcoming Cons. It is possible to have a pass for more than 1 upcoming con, if you guys ever move on to RC Amsterdam or Santiago or something.</p>


<p><b>My Challenges</b><br>
This has links to everything you're captaining, have been invited to captain, or are on the roster for. Which the case is will determine what buttons you see. If you've been invited to something, or if you've invited a captain to oppose you, and one of you has not responded, there's a little notification on the My Challenges sidebar. It's not like facebook where it goes away after you see it, it stays until it gets resolved so that if an opposing captain is being lazy and not responding, you can bug them.<br>
When you go to My Challenges, if one of the captains has not responded, it'll be red and say pending with a link to the edit page. If you've both accepted, it's unconfirmed and you get a green Edit button. If you are just on the roster and can't edit anything, you get a blue See Challenge button.</p> 

<p><b>Challenges Home</b><br>
Someday this will show you both Scheduled and Unconfirmed challenges, but right now there's no such thing as a Scheduled Challenge so it's just Unconfirmed, which means that both captains have accepted the challenge but RC has not. Challenges only show up here if both captains have accepted it.</p>

<p><b>View Challenge</b><br>
This page looks pretty different based on who you are logged in as and what information is available, which will probably be confusing to you at first but you'll get the hang of it. I tried to make it easy for average person and figured it could be a little more complex for you guys bc you'll spend more time on it.<br> 
From top to bottom:<br>
Team name vs Team name. Under that, if there's a score, like if the game already happened, there's a score. Else, nothing. If you're logged in as an NSO or a boss lady, you see a little box where you can enter and save the score. If you're not an NSO/boss and there is no score, you see nothing.<br>
On the little icon row you see the gender/intl/skill restrictions of each team. Rather than make a big explanation for that, I made it so if you hover your mouse over any of them they explain what they mean, go head and try.<br>
If you're an NSO or Boss Lady, under the team icon bar you see a little button that says, Edit Roster, which takes you to where you can add or remove skaters from this team. When you're adding skaters it pre-filters the so the only ones that show up in the dropdown are the ones that fit the gender/intl/skill criteria. I wonder if you're going to field a lot of questions about that? I.E. My friend paid for her pass, why can't I see her? Tell me what you think about that.<br>
If you're the captain of a team, under the icon bar you see a little green button that says, Edit Team which takes you to where you can edit roster, team name, color, etc. This is different from the little green button that says Edit Roster, because Edit Team lets you change team name,  gender/intl/skill, etc. Captains can change all of that, but NSOs can only change who is on a team. I think this will probably confuse you for a minute because you Boss Ladies have access to everything, but you'll get used to it. And if you want I can give you both buttons in your admin section with a reminder of what the difference is. I'm trying to make it easy for normal people to get anywhere they need to/are allowed to go.<br> 
On the team roster, if 2 numbers are the same, they show up in red and if you hover over the number to find out why it's red, it says DUPLICATE NUMBER. Do you think that's enough of a warning? I didn't make anything to change player numbers. Also, it only gets triggered if the numbers are exactly the same. So, 0 is different from 00, and 3 is different from 03 which is different from <3. <br>I figured that when the roster is taken form here and put on the Excel sheet or whatever NSOs use, they can change the number there. Speaking of, I made the roster a table so it would paste well into Excel, each part of data into their own cell/column. Want to try and see if that is good enough, or if I need to do something else to make it easier? I don't really know much about the NSO process.  <br>
In case you need examples of similar numbers, Dahmernatrix and Hell are both 505. Everyone else has a random number so I have no idea who else duplicates.  Just make sure those 2 are on a roster if you want to see this happen.</p>

<p><b>Edit Roster/Edit Challenge</b><br>
Remember: Edit Roster is for Boss Ladies/NSOs, and Edit Challenge is for captains.<br>
I might have gone a little notification-crazy on this page, I just wanted it to be really obvious what's going on all the time. For example, it has the little green thing that tells you if your opposing captain has accepted the challenge, and that's always there unless they change their mind and reject it later. I kept it there all of the time for that reason, because it's possible someone will accept a challenge, then realize that they can only captain 2, and change their minds. If they do change their mind and reject it later, when you log on this will be red and it'll say, You don't have an opponent! and it'll let you choose another captain to challenge. The options of who to challenge ended up being pretty much everyone that has a Skater/MVP pass for the year (that isn't already captaining 2 challenges), since it made no sense to filter an opposing team by the same criteria as the initial team (since they're often opposites). If a captain accepts a challenge and then rejects it later, the next captain can pick up where the old one left off, the roster and details are still intact (but they can change it, of course). Maybe it's a little weird for the next captain to get the other one's sloppy seconds, but I wanted it to be easy in case a flake changed their mind at the last minute. If both captains reject a challenge, it gets erased.<br>

If you change the gender/intl/skill status of a challenge, it checks to see if you'll be making any skaters ineligible, and if there are any, it warns you before kicking them off. There is a little exception to this, which is that the captain of a team is always on the team, so if Ivanna is a woman and makes her team all men, it doesn't throw her off. I don't know if that matters much, letting this loophole exist, it's just way easier than the alternative of not letting her change the team until she changes her own profile blah blah headache. BTW this same warning happens if you change your own profile in such a way that will kick you off some rosters, just to make sure that someone doesn't change their details every time they see something else they want to sign up for. BTW is that going ot be a problem, making people choose a gender for 4 days? Because right now, anyone can sign up for a Coed/NA roster, but if you choose Coed/NA as your gender, those are the only activities you can sign up for-- not female only or make only<br>
Edit Challenge doesn't really display the whole roster bc there was so much else to put on the page, but every time you add or remove a skater it tells you, and you can see the roster if you see who you can remove, but maybe that's too complex for the average pass holder. Tell me f you want me to add an update roster list somewhere on this page (...and maybe guidance as to where? I think this page is kinda packed as it is.)<br>
The Edit Roster page for NSOs and Boss Ladies has the roster list though, because they don't have as many other options.</p>

<p><b>Submit Challenge</b><br>
The reason there's a field to choose which Con is because it's possible to be registered for more than has not happened yet and you can submit for either. I might try to hide it if you're only registered for 1, or maybe I'll just leave it and let people think it's redundant. I dunno.</p>

<p><b>Submit Training</b><br>
I made a cool little button so that if you've submitted a training before you can easily clone it to submit it again, If you submit an off-skates training it lets you choose how long the training will be afterwards, otherwise it is 2 hours long. Technically this could be exploited by people finding that out, and starting off with their training as off-skates, choosing a time duration, then editing it to be on skates. Do you think that'll be a problem, or do you think no one will ever notice?
</p>

<p><b>Registering for a Training</b><br>
Later this will only let volunteers do it if it's 2 hours before the class, but the schedule doesn't exist yet so neither does that part.<br>
I did something that maybe people will think is a bug but it;s not-- you can only be registered for a class if you fit the skill/intl/gender criteria (it's possible to set your class so there's no criteria for those and everyone is welcome, btw). But in the case of INTL classes where they might not fill up, instead of letting volunteers override and register someone anyway, I just made the audit cap way bigger, and  made a not that the coach MIGHT let auditing skaters participate in the training if there' space. But I still kept Registered for INTLs only.<br>
Also, lemme just clarify-- my understanding is that only MVPs can audit on skates classes, but Skater and Off Skates pass holders can register for/audit off skates trainings. Is that right? I guess you don't usually register people for off skates trainings, do you? Well, it's possible, and the way I have it is that if a training is off-skates a Skater or Off Skates person can sign up too.
</p>

<p><b>icons</b><br>
I sidestepped the gender thing by making a universal access icon and using it every time something has no restrictions, like any skill, intl, or gender allowed. On second thought I'm not sure why gender was included in the training/challenge criteria, i think it's just going to piss people off for no reason. Are events ever actuly restricted by gender?</p>

<p>I think that's the main gist. Want to play with it and let me know what you think of the general flow, or if you find any bugs? If you find an error, please try to take a screenshot including the address bar. I plan on making Trainings pretty similar, so if there are any changes I'd like to know now so I don't need to do anything twice.</p>
