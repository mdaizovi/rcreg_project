He was a featured skater in a bunch of TV commercials, loves to jump rows of skaters laying on the ground, can skate with his skate on his ass better than most of you can skate with 'em on your feet, and has a new pair of flashy shoes every single time you lay eyes on him.  He guest coaches all over and has been seen rocking both flat and banked tracks on several continents.

Quadzilla LK started skating in diapers and joined his first derby team roughly sometime before puberty (which was way earlier than most of you people think), in the dark ages when the sport was played on inline skates by people with enormous hair and you were probably still teething.  He was a featured skater in a bunch of TV commercials, loves to jump rows of skaters laying on the ground, can skate with his skate on his ass better than most of you can skate with 'em on your feet, and has a new pair of flashy shoes every single time you lay eyes on him.  He guest coaches all over and has been seen rocking both flat and banked tracks on several continents.  He plays mens derby for the Puget Sound Outcasts, and developed Antik Skates, Heartless and B'Zerk Wheels and Gumball Stops. We heard he was once a pro snowboarder.  He doesn't have anything at all to do with Derby News Network and has never been a ref, though he's not above wearing a dress if the situation calls for it.  He likes the kind of sushi that has fried things and cream cheese in it.  We don't think he's a super hero, but he does actually have a sidekick named Boy (something). For real.

Quadzilla LK started skating in diapers and joined his first derby team roughly sometime before puberty (which was way earlier than most of you people think), in the dark ages when the sport was played on inline skates by people with enormous hair and you were probably still teething.  He was a featured skater in a bunch of TV commercials, loves to jump rows of skaters laying on the ground, can skate with his skate on his ass better than most of you can skate with 'em on your feet, and has a new pair of flashy shoes every single time you lay eyes on him.  He guest coaches all over and has been seen rocking both flat and banked tracks on several continents.  He plays mens derby for the Puget Sound Outcasts, and developed Antik Skates, Heartless and B'Zerk Wheels and Gumball Stops. We heard he was once a pro snowboarder.  He doesn't have anything at all to do with Derby News Network and has never been a ref, though he's not above wearing a dress if the situation calls for it.  He likes the kind of sushi that has fried things and cream cheese in it.  We don't think he's a super hero, but he does actually have a sidekick named Boy (something). For real.
